##Towards faster algorithms for online learning


Consider complex performance measures : ranking objectives like
pAUC or precision@K. Also consider simpler objectives that can be expressed
as concave or pseudo linear combinations of TPR and TNR. We would like to 
find converging, fast algorithms for optimizing such measures.


###Online versions of SPADE/STAMP

Look at Bubeck's Mirror Descent for Saddle Point method. 
[Link](https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2013/04/18/orf523-mirror-descent-part-iiii/)

This could be adapted in the STAMP/SPADE setting. Now refer to 
older notes for online to batch conversions (Set up a Martingale and then
use Azuma-Hoeffding's).


###Bandit versions of SPADE/STAMP

Work with multi-class performance measures and look into the banditron 
algorithm. Maybe that can be used as inspiration.

[This](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/narasimhanb15.html) is a 
relevant paper that used the ideas from SPADE and STAMP and extended it to
the multi-class setting.



###Delayed versions of SPADE/STAMP

[This](https://www.cs.uic.edu/pub/Ziebart/Publications/wang2015adversarial.pdf)
could give us insights into how to use some game theory ideas.

Look at the further papers put on project page.
