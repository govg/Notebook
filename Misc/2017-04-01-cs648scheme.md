## Question 1

### Expected solution

Choose $k$ vertices, do BFS from each vertex and update the distance matrix
with the best distance given by BFS. Choosing $k = O(\log n)$ will give required
bound, with some particular constant

---

## Question 2

### Expected solution

Construct a random variable $R_k$ which denotes the number of edges that are 
needed to make the graph go from $k$ connected components to $k-1$ components.
Note, $R_n = 1$, but others are actually "variables". Compute expected value
of sum, and bound it tightly to obtain $\sum_2^n R_i = O(\log n)$.

## Question 3


## Part 1

### Expected solution

- Obtain required probability as $\frac{1}{2^l}$. 
- Choose a random matrix, hash from number to bucket ID
- Matrix has $kl$ entries, so that is the number of bits required.



## Part 2

### Expected solution

Hash both sets into different hash tables, using discussion in class.

Compare frequency values of multiset and return true if all values match, false if
not.
