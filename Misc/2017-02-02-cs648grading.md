## Choice 1

### Statement:

Prove that with high probability there will be no bin containing more than
$O(log(n))$ balls if we throw **n** balls randomly uniformly and independently
into **n** bins.

### Solution:

Let us consider the probability of a single bin containing at least k balls.

Using $X_i$ to denote the number of balls in bin $i$, 

$P(X_i \geq k) \leq \binom{n}{k} \left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^k$ 


We can further simplify this into:

$P(X_i \geq k) \leq \binom{n}{k} \left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^k \leq \frac{n^k}{k!} \left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^k = \frac{1}{k!}$


From Union bound, we have that probability of any bin containing at least k balls
can be bounded by, 

$P(\exists i : X_i \geq k) \leq \frac{n}{k!}$

Choosing $k = O(log(n))$ and using Stirling's Approximation, we can get

$P(\exists i : X_i \geq k) \leq \frac{1}{poly(n)}$


Which completes our required proof

## Choice 2

### Statement:

Let $P(n)$ denote the set of prime numbers less than or equal to **n**. Design
a Las Vegas algorithm that receives a positive number **n** and outputs a
prime number randomly uniformly from the set $P(n)$. The algorithm must run
in expected $O(polylog(n))$ time. 


### Solution:

Observation : 

- Number of primes in set $\{1, 2, ..., n\} = \frac{n}{log(n)}$.
- Probability of finding a prime in this set $= \frac{1}{log(n)}$

#### Algorithm:

1. Receive number n
2. Choose a number uniformly, randomly from set $\{2, ..., n\}$.
3. Check whether this number is prime via AKS or any other method
4. Discard if number is not prime and go back to step 2
5. Report number

#### Running time analysis:

AKS step takes $O(log^4(n))$.

The expected number of iterations before finding a prime is $O(log(n))$ - can be 
found via $\mathbb{E}\left[X\right] = \sum^{\infty} i * \left[ \left(\frac{1}{log(n)} \right) * \left(1-\frac{1}{log(n)}\right)^{i-1} \right]$


Total running time = $O(log^5(n))$.



### Marking scheme:

- Correct algorithm - 3 marks
- Usage of AKS		- 3 marks
	- Anything else which works - 2 marks
- Correct expected number of iterations - 4 marks
